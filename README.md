# 📊 Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

This project demonstrates a comprehensive data warehousing and analytics solution—from building a data warehouse to generating actionable insights.  
It was designed as a **personal portfolio project** to practice and showcase skills in SQL, data modeling, and analytics, while following industry best practices.

## 🔗 About the Original Project

This project is adapted from [@DataWithBaraa](https://github.com/DataWithBaraa/sql-data-warehouse-project), who provided the original datasets and schema design.

The original project used **SQL Server**, and I translated the SQL code and logic into **MySQL**.  
This allowed me to better understand SQL syntax differences and practice data warehousing concepts hands-on.

The SQL work, translation to MySQL, and analysis were done by me as a way to practice real-world SQL skills.
